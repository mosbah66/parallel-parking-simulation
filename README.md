# Parallel Parking Simulation (IU Case Study DLBROESR01_E)

This repository contains a Python simulation of an autonomous reverse parallel
parking maneuver for a self-driving car. The simulation implements the bicycle
kinematic model, visualizes the trajectory, and plots steering/velocity profiles.

## Features
- Realistic car geometry and nonholonomic constraints
- Forward kinematic simulation of parallel parking
- Exportable plots for academic report inclusion
- Simple to run in Google Colab or any Python environment

## How to Run
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
python parallel_parking_simulation.py
